            <li>Samuel Vimes is a fictional character from the Discworld series of novels, written by Terry Prachett.</li>
            <li>Sam Vimes was born in Cockbill Street as the son of Thomas Vimes, (son of Gwilliam Vimes) in the Rimwards part of the Shades, the poorest area of Ankh-Morpork.</li>
            <li>Vime's first appearance is in the novel Guards! Guards!, which is the 8th Discworld novel.</li>
            <li>Vimes was sixteen when he joined the Watch. He was part of that section of the Watch which played a large role in the rebellion against Homicidal Lord Winder. It was around this time he was taught all he knew by Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel, which is where his cynical outlook on life and his firm belief in justice comes from.</li>
            <li>Vimes married Lady Sybil, who was a Wagnerian aristocrat and a kind and compassionate person. With her, Vimes had a son, Young Sam. </li>
            <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.arts.sf.written/c/pd4gQj2oN6U?pli=1#acfb8cc6c17a4e7b" >Terry Pratchett noted the following about Vimes on Usenet:</a> "Vimes is fundamentally a person. He fears he may be a bad person because he knows what he thinks rather than just what he says and does. He chokes off all of those little reactions and impulses, but he knows what they are. So he tries to act like a good person, often in situations where the map is unclear."</li>
